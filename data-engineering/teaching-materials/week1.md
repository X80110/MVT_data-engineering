  - Profiles

# Approaching new tasks in Python

- Break the problem down into small chunks or steps
- It can help to write out these steps in comments
- Think about the task in terms of inputs and outputs
  - Each step can also be thought of in that way
- Experiment with interactive environments

## Resources

- Official documentation
  - API reference
  - Official guides
  - Example code & projects
- Tutorials
- Q&A websites (e.g. Stack Overflow)
- Open source projects

# Standard libraries vs third-party libraries

## Standard library

- Included with the language (no additional software required)
- Will work everywhere
- Typically better tested and more reliable
- Documentation and support can be better
- Lower level (not always a good thing)

## Third-party library

- Provide provide extra functionality
- Sometimes they provide a higher level interface
- Can be quicker in some situations
- Can be more performant
